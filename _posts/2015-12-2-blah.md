Very few runs have finished since yesterday we seem to be stuck on a lot of -log likelihood valleys, which blows. The iterations go on forever.

What to do? Restart if model fails to converge? But that suggests some fallibility to the model and would ask for multiple runs across all PWMs, which is not palatable (nor, realistically, feasible). Things that need to be done are piling up - prepare all the back-end TF binding stuff, and also go back to the more straight-forward windows near TSS stuff, which is easier to interpret. 
 
Told Shyam about possible bug, he was looking into it, will hopefully find out more later today. If it is a bug I am THIS close to wanting to go back to basic centipede, but then I will have to wrestle with all the input files and that is not worth my time, to be honest. 

Should maybe read some papers instead.
