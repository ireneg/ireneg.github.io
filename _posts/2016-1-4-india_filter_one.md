Starting again with India. Took the mastersheet of individuals and filtered down to the following set of individuals, after pruning all known relatives and duplicates according to the relevant columns:

Continents:
* Africa
* Caucaus
* Central Asia
* Europe
* East Asia
* South Asia
* Southern Asia

Publications:
* Hapmap 3 Gujaratis (their own analysis group, surely)
* Li et al 2008
* Metspalu et al 2011
* Central Asians from Raghavan et al 2013
* Non-Europeans from Yunusbayev et al 2012
* Non-Europeans from Yunusbayev et al 2015

African non-farmers from the HGDP were also excluded.

Before any more filtering, that's down to 1171 samples. I will probably end up filtering some more, and still need to decide how best to split the Indian samples. On the plus side, the Sanger CMS pipeline scripts I wrote years ago are well-documented and should make obtaining the data pretty easy, once I solve my SSH problem and can actually connect to the relevant servers.
