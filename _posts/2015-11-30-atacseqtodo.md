- [ ] from `scan.motifs.sh`: find a way to scan the HT-SELEX motifs, since scanPwm will not handle them, although the new if-else test is functional.
- [ ] from `scan.motifs.sh`: generate motif/PWM files in a chimp-centric way, compare.
- [ ] from `run_mscentipede.sh`: convert to a job-ID task-based system for launching all 1000+ comparative jobs.
