title: batch processing of PWM motifs
layout: post
tags: mscentipede

Fixed the script to run the PWM scan motif code as a batch on all PWMs at once. Seems to be running so far; see today's bitbucket commits for more details. 
Got the list of high IC PWMs from A, tho need to double-check that there's nothing wrong with them. 

Next up, batch running of msCentipede, and finishing the easy part of the analyses with limma.
