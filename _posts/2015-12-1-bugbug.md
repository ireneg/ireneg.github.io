title: msCentipede bug?
tags: mscentipede

A couple of runs of msCentipede have thrown what appears to be a bug:

M05589 failed in chimps and M01123 failed in humans. They have very different numbers of PWM sites, but they fail in identical ways suggesting a bug; here is the log file for M01123 in humans:

```
Learning binding model in humans for motif M01123.
loading motifs ... 
num of motif sites = 10000

Traceback (most recent call last):

```

Another concern is this line from the log file:

```
num of motif sites = 10000
```

M01123 actually has >300k sites, so I hope this is just the program meaning >10K but only reporting 10k. Will talk to Anil about it.
