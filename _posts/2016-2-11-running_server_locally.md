Had some concerns about privacy and the India data in particular, so I decided to dig around and find a way to serve the lab notebook privately or locally without abandoning the git workflow, since it's clearly what works best for me (none of that copy-paste nonsense, thanks v much). 

Anyhow, installed jekyll on work computer and all needed dependencies and I can now write the site locally in markdown and serve it as html just by running jekyll locally, which is a big advantage. I'll need to move it to a new repo instead, but it should not be hard, although the problem is what to do with the previous one - do I save it only for big posts? Nevertheless, this progress makes me quite happy. 

Could still host images on github, but it is probably easier to host them on dropbox instead.
